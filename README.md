#Maitree

Maitree is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that its wide proportion was designed so it can fit on a device with a variety of screen and form factors. It is characterized by its bigger-than-usual Looped terminal and Serifs that balance out the whole structure. Maitree offers a 6 weight family, and its asymmetry curved terminal is well-suited for both formal and casual usage especially for works that require antique and historical manner.

Maitree means friendliness.
