#Maitree Font

Maitree is a modern serif typeface and Thai Loop terminal typeface that has a friendly and welcoming form. The objective of this project is to design the font that can be used in any informal context. Besides, its open part of negative space and its overall width make it highly legible and readable on electronic platform. For Thai alphabets, the counter of looped terminal was designed to be wider than usual and share serif from Latin to make this typeface look informal as intended. The family consists of 6 weights.
